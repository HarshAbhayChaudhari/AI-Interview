    {
      "question_id": 1,
      "question": "How would you use a VLOOKUP in Excel? Please provide a practical example with sample data.",
      "answer": "VLOOKUP helps you find data in a table. You use it like =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup). For example, if I have employee names in column A and their salaries in column B, I can use =VLOOKUP(\"John\", A:B, 2, FALSE) to find John's salary. The FALSE means exact match.",

    {
      "question_id": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative cell references. When would you use each?",
      "answer": "Relative references change when you copy formulas, like A1. Absolute references don't change, like $A$1. You use absolute references when you want to always reference the same cell, like a tax rate. Relative references are used when you want the formula to adjust for each row or column.",

    {
      "question_id": 3,
      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it? Walk me through creating one.",
      "answer": "A pivot table summarizes data. You use it to analyze large amounts of data quickly. To create one, you select your data, go to Insert, click PivotTable, choose where to put it, then drag fields to different areas. You can put categories in rows and values in the values area to see totals.",

      "question_id": 4,
      "question": "How do you handle duplicate values in Excel? What are the different methods available?",
      "answer": "You can find duplicates using conditional formatting. Go to Home, Conditional Formatting, Highlight Cells Rules, Duplicate Values. You can also use the Remove Duplicates feature in the Data tab. I think there might be other ways but I'm not sure about the formulas.",

    {
      "question_id": 5,
      "question": "Write a formula to calculate the average of cells A1 through A10, excluding blank cells and zeros.",
      "answer": "I think you can use =AVERAGE(A1:A10) but that won't exclude zeros. Maybe =SUM(A1:A10)/COUNT(A1:A10) but that still includes zeros. I'm not sure about excluding both blanks and zeros. I might need to use a more complex formula or filter the data first.",

      "question_id": 6,
      "question": "How would you create a dynamic chart that updates automatically when new data is added?",
      "answer": "I'm not sure about this. Maybe you can use a table and the chart will update? Or you might need to manually update the chart range when you add new data. I haven't worked much with dynamic charts before.",

For examples: =COUNT(A1:A10) counts numbers, =COUNTA(A1:A10) counts non-empty cells, =COUNTIF(A1:A10,\">5\") counts cells greater than 5. I'm not sure about COUNTIFS syntax.",
