      "question_id": 1,
      "question": "How would you use a VLOOKUP in Excel? Please provide a practical example with sample data.",
      "answer": "VLOOKUP is used to find a value in the first column of a table and return a value from the same row in another column. For example, if I have a table with employee IDs in column A and names in column B, I can use =VLOOKUP(123, A:B, 2, FALSE) to find the name for employee ID 123. The FALSE parameter ensures exact match. I'd also mention that VLOOKUP can only look to the right, so if I need to look left, I'd use INDEX/MATCH instead.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative cell references. When would you use each?",
      "answer": "Relative references change when copied (like A1), absolute references stay fixed (like $A$1), and mixed references fix either row or column (like $A1 or A$1). I use relative references for formulas that should adjust when copied, like calculating totals down a column. Absolute references are perfect for referencing a constant value like a tax rate or conversion factor that's in a fixed cell. Mixed references are great for creating multiplication tables or when you want to reference a specific row or column that shouldn't change.",

    {
      "question_id": 3,
      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it? Walk me through creating one.",
      "answer": "A pivot table is a powerful data summarization tool that lets you analyze large datasets by grouping and aggregating data. I'd use it to analyze sales data by region, summarize survey responses, or find trends in financial data. To create one: 1) Select your data range, 2) Go to Insert > PivotTable, 3) Choose where to place it, 4) Drag fields to Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters areas. For example, I might put 'Region' in Rows, 'Product' in Columns, and 'Sales' in Values to see sales by region and product. I can also add filters for specific time periods.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": 4,
      "question": "How do you handle duplicate values in Excel? What are the different methods available?",
      "answer": "There are several ways to handle duplicates: 1) Conditional formatting to highlight duplicates using Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Duplicate Values, 2) Remove duplicates using Data > Remove Duplicates, 3) Use COUNTIF formula to identify duplicates like =COUNTIF(A:A,A1)>1, 4) Advanced Filter to show unique values only. I'd use conditional formatting first to identify the duplicates, then decide whether to remove them or keep them based on the business requirement. For data cleaning, I'd use Remove Duplicates, but I'd always make a backup first.",

      "question_id": 5,
      "question": "Write a formula to calculate the average of cells A1 through A10, excluding blank cells and zeros.",
      "answer": "I can use =AVERAGEIF(A1:A10,\"<>0\",A1:A10) to exclude zeros, but this won't exclude blanks. For both blanks and zeros, I'd use =AVERAGEIFS(A1:A10,A1:A10,\"<>0\",A1:A10,\"<>\"&\"\") or the simpler =SUM(A1:A10)/COUNTIF(A1:A10,\">0\"). Actually, the cleanest approach is =AVERAGEIF(A1:A10,\">0\") which automatically excludes both blanks and zeros since blanks are treated as zero in comparisons.",
