    {
      "question_id": 1,
      "question": "How would you use a VLOOKUP in Excel? Please provide a practical example with sample data.",
      "answer": "I think VLOOKUP is used to look up values, but I'm not sure about the exact syntax. I've heard of it but haven't used it much. Maybe it's something like =VLOOKUP and then you put in what you're looking for and where to find it? I'm not confident about this.",

    {
      "question_id": 2,
      "question": "Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative cell references. When would you use each?",
      "answer": "I know that when you copy formulas, sometimes the cell references change and sometimes they don't. The dollar signs have something to do with it, like $A$1. But I'm not sure exactly when to use them or what the difference is between relative and absolute references.",

      "question_id": 3,
      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it? Walk me through creating one.",
      "answer": "A pivot table is for analyzing data, I think. You can use it to summarize information. To create one, you go to the Insert tab and click PivotTable. Then you select your data and choose where to put it. After that, I'm not sure what to do with the fields and how to organize the data.",

    {
      "question_id": 4,
      "question": "How do you handle duplicate values in Excel? What are the different methods available?",
      "answer": "I think you can find duplicates using conditional formatting. You go to Home, then Conditional Formatting, and there's an option for duplicates. I'm not sure about other methods or how to actually remove the duplicates. I might just delete them manually.",

      "question_id": 5,
      "question": "Write a formula to calculate the average of cells A1 through A10, excluding blank cells and zeros.",
      "answer": "I know =AVERAGE(A1:A10) calculates the average, but I don't know how to exclude blanks and zeros. Maybe I could filter the data first or use a different function? I'm not sure about the syntax for excluding specific values.",

      "question": "How would you create a dynamic chart that updates automatically when new data is added?",
      "answer": "I don't know how to make charts that update automatically. I usually create charts manually and then update them when I add new data. Maybe there's a way to do this, but I haven't learned about it yet.",
