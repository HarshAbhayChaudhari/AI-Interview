        self.session_id = session_id
        self.current_question = 0
        self.answers = []
        self.status = "active"
        self.start_time = datetime.now()
    
    def add_answer(self, answer: Answer):
        self.answers.append(answer)
        self.current_question += 1
    
    def is_complete(self) -> bool:
        return self.current_question >= len(QUESTIONS)
    
    def get_progress(self) -> float:
        return self.current_question / len(QUESTIONS)
```

#### Frontend State Management
```javascript
const [interviewState, setInterviewState] = useState({
  sessionId: null,
  candidateName: '',
  currentQuestion: 0,
  answers: [],
  evaluation: null,
  isFinished: false
});
```
